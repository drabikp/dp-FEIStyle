  abstract = {Purpose Augmented reality (AR) has become one of the most promising technologies in construction since it can seamlessly connect the physical construction environment and virtual contents. In view of the recent research efforts, this study attempts to summarize the latest research achievements and inform future development of AR in construction. Design/methodology/approach The review was conducted in three steps. First, a keyword search was adopted, and 546 papers were found from Scopus and Web of Science. Second, each paper was screened based on the selection criteria, and a final set of 69 papers was obtained. Third, specific AR applications and the associated technical details were extracted from the 69 papers for further analysis. Findings The review shows that: (1) design assessment, process monitoring and maintenance management and operation were the most frequently cited AR applications in the design, construction, and operation stages, respectively; (2) information browser and tangible interaction were more frequently adopted than collaborative interaction and hybrid interaction; and (3) AR has been integrated with BIM, computer vision, and cloud computing for enhanced functions. Originality/value The contributions of this study to the body of knowledge are twofold. First, this study extends the understanding of AR applications in the construction setting. Second, this study identifies possible improvements in the design and development of AR systems in order to leverage their benefits to construction.},

  abstract = {Research on educational Augmented Reality (AR) began approximately three decades ago, starting in the early 1990s. Since then, numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have synthesized evidence regarding its impact on learning. However, these analyses have reported mixed results, ranging from a small to a medium impact. Mixed results are common, especially in meta-analyses, as this type of study cannot eliminate sampling error variance. Consequently, their conclusions may be affected by sample bias and publication bias. This study presents a second-order meta-analysis to identify more reliable insights into the impact of AR in educational settings. For this study, we synthesized 19 eligible articles, incorporating 21 effect sizes from first-order meta-analyses that explored the impact of AR in comparison to non-AR control groups. These meta-analyses encompassed 657 effect sizes derived from 273 primary studies published between 2000 and 2022. Furthermore, we analyzed the moderating effects of domain discipline, participants, and the type of learning outcome. Quantitative analysis revealed that AR has a medium impact on learning outcomes (g=0.64,p\&lt;.001; 95\% CI [0.56,0.72]). Contrary to our expectations, the findings of this study indicate that none of the three factors - discipline, participants, and type of learning outcome - moderated the effect of AR on learning. This implies that the impact of AR is consistent across disciplines, participant characteristics, and outcome measures. The study concludes that AR has been a versatile pedagogical alternative in education and can successfully complement educational processes. Finally, the study explains the limitations of the results and highlights new directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract The technological revolution of past decades has led teaching and learning of evolutionary biology to move away from its naturalist origins. As a result, students’ learning experiences and training on the science of natural history—which entails careful observations and meticulous data curation to generate insight—have been compromised compared with the times of the pioneers in the field. But will technology cause the extinction of natural history in its traditional form? In this essay, we provide a visionary—albeit not yet possible—perspective of the future of natural history in the technological era. We review the main concepts and applications of key state-state-of-the-art technologies to the teaching and learning of Biology including Virtual and Mixed Reality (VMR). Next, we review the current knowledge in artificial life, and describe our visionary model for the future of natural history voyages—the BioVR—which is an immersive world where students can experience evolution in action, and also shape how evolution can occur in virtual worlds. We finish the essay with a cautionary tale as to the known negative sides of using VMR technologies, and why future applications should be designed with care to protect the intended learning outcomes and students’ experience. Our aim is to stimulate debates on how new technologies can revolutionise teaching and learning across scenarios, which can be useful for improving learning outcomes of biological concepts in face-to-face, blended, and distance learning programmes.},

  abstract = {How we interact with computer graphics has not changed significantly from viewing 2D text and images on a flatscreen since their invention. Yet, recent advances in computing technology, internetworked devices and gaming are driving the design and development of new ideas in other modes of human-computer interfaces (HCIs). Virtual Reality (VR) technology uses computers and HCIs to create the feeling of immersion in a three-dimensional (3D) environment that contains interactive objects with a sense of spatial presence , where objects have a spatial location relative to, and independent of the users. While this virtual environment does not necessarily match the real world, by creating the illusion of reality, it helps users leverage the full range of human sensory capabilities. Similarly, Augmented Reality (AR), superimposes virtual images to the real world. Because humans learn the physical world through a gradual sensory familiarization, these immersive visualizations enable gaining familiarity with biological systems not realizable in the physical world (e.g., allosteric regulatory networks within a protein or biomolecular pathways inside a cell). As VR/AR interfaces are anticipated to be explosive in consumer markets, systems biologists will be more immersed into their world. Here we introduce a brief history of VR/AR, their current roles in systems biology, and advantages and disadvantages in augmenting user abilities. We next argue that in systems biology, VR/AR technologies will be most useful in visually exploring and communicating data; performing virtual experiments; and education/teaching. Finally, we discuss our perspective on future directions for VR/AR in systems biology.}
